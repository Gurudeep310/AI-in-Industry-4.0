My project is on building an AR dinopedia app. Here on pointing a image to the phone camera you can capture the Dino in 3d.

Use Case:
- Can serve as an interactive and engaging learning tool for students of all ages. 
- Users can explore and learn about different dinosaurs. 
- This can make the learning experience more memorable and enjoyable.
- 3D models can help users visualize the size, anatomy, and behavior of dinosaurs more effectively than traditional 2D images or text descriptions. 
- This aids in a better understanding of paleontology concepts.

This project could be extended to a bigger collection on AR dinosaur models and serve as a greater tool paleontology studies. Currently this tool works for android version 6.0 and above
